  <h1>What is Elements?</h1>
</div>

Elements is a modern music library application built in Python3
and Kivy. It is designed primarily for music aficionados who want
an extra level of organization for their library.

<h2>Why "Yet Another" Music Player?</h2>

The idea for Elements came from my dissatisfaction with every
other music player out there. There were very few that would let me
curate my massive library the way I wanted. Of those, even fewer had a
clean, uncluttered interface I liked.

Finally, none solved my ongoing problem of "what do I want to listen to
today?" The same albums would be displayed by default, leading me to
forget about favorite albums deeper in the default search results.

I hope to solve these problems with Elements.
